# Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)

The [Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package](https://www.vasp.at/) (VASP) is atomic scale 
materials modelling software available on the CRC clusters.

VASP licenses are given to individual research groups, and they are not institution or department wide licenses.

When requesting to use this software for themselves or on behalf of users in their group, PIs should make sure that 
they [have acquired a proper license](https://www.vasp.at/info/faq/).

It is their responsibility to make sure that users are officially registered / removed from the registration list 
as staff and students join / leave their group.

For questions about module access and running VASP jobs on the clusters, 
please [submit a ticket](https://crc.pitt.edu/tickets).
