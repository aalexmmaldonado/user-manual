# Mathematica Software

## Licensing Restrictions

All students enrolled at Pitt may use Mathematica free of charge.

A per-user fee [$60 per year](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/software/mathematica-faculty-staff-depts) is 
required for Faculty, Staff, and postdoctoral researchers. A license must be purchased for each user.

## Verifying Licensed User

After CRC verifies with Pitt Software Licensing that you have a license, we will permit you access to Mathematica on 
the cluster.
